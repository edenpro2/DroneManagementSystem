OBI-WAN
We are here to relieve you of
Chancellor Palpatine, not join him.

OBI-WAN
Anakin ...

ANAKIN
Ready.

OBI-WAN
... fuel. The slightest charge
from our sabers will send this ship
into oblivion. That's why they've
stopped shooting.

ANAKIN
Well then, we're safe for the time
being.

OBI-WAN
Your idea of safe is not the same
as mine.

ANAKIN
They're sealing this section off.

OBI-WAN
Six droids corning our way!
The last of the DOORS CAN BE HEARD CLOSING in the distance.

ANAKIN
Keep moving. There must be vents ...
This way.

OBI-WAN
We'll never get through that. It's
too small!

ANAKIN
I found our escape vent.

OBI-WAN
Anakin, this is no time for jokes.
We're in serious trouble here.

ANAKIN
Only in your mind. My Master. Look,
no structure .... 

ANAKIN
Here's a way out.

OBI-WAN
That won't hold when the fuel hits
those power dischargers .

OBI-WAN
You still have much to learn, Anakin.

DROID
I have a bad feeling about this.

OBI-WAN
All right, you win. I have much to
learn. Let's go!

ANAKIN
Destroyers!!

DROID
Drop your weapons! I said drop 'em.

DROID
Ahhhh

OBI-WAN
Did you press the stop button?

ANAKIN
No, did you?

OBI-WAN
No!

ANAKIN
Well, there's more than one way out
of here.

OBI-WAN
We don't want to get out, we want
to get moving. Artoo ... Artoo. Do
you copy? Activate elevator ...
(looks at control panel)
... 31174 ...

DROID
What's that?

DROID
Get back to work. It's nothing. 

OBI-WAN
Artoo?

OBI-WAN
(continuing}
Always on the move.

OBI-WAN
Artoo, switch on the comlink.
Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we
gave you a job to do! Artoo.

OBI-WAN
Stop, stop! Artoo, we need to be
going up.

DROID
Hands up, Jedi! Don't move.

DROID
Roger, roger.

OBI-WAN
Artoo, do you copy? Artoo, do you
hear me? Artoo, we need to be going
up, not down.

OBI-WAN
Stop. Artoo! We need to go up!
Stop, stop!

OBI-WAN
Now, that's better ... 

OBI-WAN
Oh, it's you ...

ANAKIN
What was that all about?

OBI-WAN
Well, Artoo has been ...

ANAKIN
No loose wire jokes ... He's doing
the best he can.

OBI-WAN
Did I say anything? 

ANAKIN
He's trying!

OBI-WAN
I didn't say anything!

OBI-WAN
(bows)

ANAKIN
Chancellor, are you all right?

PALPATINE
Count Dooku.

OBI-WAN
This time we will do it together. 

ANAKIN
I was about to say that.

PALPATINE
Get help! You're no match for him.
He's a Sith Lord.

OBI-WAN
Chancellor Palpatine. Sith Lords are
our specialty.

COUNT-DOOKU
Your swords, please, Master Jedi. We
don't want to make a mess of things
in front of the Chancellor.

OBI-WAN
You won't get away this time,
Dooku.

COUNT-DOOKU
I've been looking forward to this.

ANAKIN
My powers have doubled since the
last time we met, Count.

COUNT-DOOKU
Good. Twice the pride, double the
fall.

COUNT-DOOKU
Your moves are clumsy, Kenobi
too predictable. You'll have to do
better.

COUNT-DOOKU
I sense great fear in you, Skywalker.
You have hate, you have anger, but you
don't use them.

PALPATINE
Good, Anakin, good. I knew you could
do it. Kill him. Kill him now!

ANAKIN
I shouldn't ...

PALPATINE
Do it!!

ANAKIN
... I couldn't stop myself.

PALPATINE
You did well, Anakin. He was too
dangerous to be kept alive.

ANAKIN
Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.

ANAKIN
I shouldn't have done that,
Chancellor. It's not the Jedi way.

PALPATINE
It is only natural. He cut off your
arm, and you wanted revenge. It. wasn't
the first time, Anakin. Remember what
you told me about your mother and the
Sand People. Now, we must leave before
more security droids arrive.

PALPATINE
Anakin, there is no time. We must get
off the ship before it's too late.

ANAKIN
He seems to be all right. No broken
bones, breathing's all right.

PALPATINE
Leave him, or we'll never make it.

ANAKIN
His fate will be the same as ours.

ANAKIN
The elevator's not working,Artoo ...

ANAKIN
... Activate Elevator 3224.

ANAKIN
Artoo ... do you copy? Artoo, come
in!

ANAKIN
Easy ... We're in a bit of a
situation.

OBI-WAN
Did I miss something?

ANAKIN
Hold on.

OBI-WAN
What is that?

OBI-WAN
Oops.

ANAKIN
Artoo, Artoo, shut down the
elevator!

OBI-WAN
Too late! Jump!

OBI-WAN
Let's see if we can find something
in the hangar bay that's still
flyable. Come on.

ANAKIN
Artoo, get down here. Artoo, do you
copy?

OBI-WAN
None of those ships will get us
anywhere.

ANAKIN
I agree.

PALPATINE
What are we going to do?

ANAKIN
I don't know.

OBI-WAN
Don't look at me. I don't know.

ANAKIN
Here, Chancellor, lock this around
your waist, and hold on.

OBI-WAN
We'll-head toward the bridge and see
if we can find an escape pod.
