# Drone Management System (Drone DBMS)
Welcome to my C# Windows "Mini" Project for JCT Lev International Program in Computer Science. I am a second year CS student from Florida, currently living in Israel. This project is part of my course in C#. The project allows for both customers and employees to use a Drone Management System (DMS) with UI/UX design. For customers, they are greeted with a login page and the ability to register. Once logged in, they are able to look at their packages (incoming and sent), change profile settings and send a new parcel. For employees, they have lists of all entities and the ability to see each entity's details in a new window.

# Note
Bonuses and personal additions are in the word doc files accordingly

## Bonuses
* Location coordinates in sexagesimal format, for user readability
* Option that picks the coordinates of any point and prints distance
from a base or client to this point
* In all windows, prevent the window from being closed "by force" by
pressing â¨‰ in the corner of the window, unless pressing the predefined
custom button
* Customer log that allows basic functions for a regular customer
* Design Pattern - Class BL is a Thread-Safe Singleton with maximum
lazy initialization
* Design Pattern - Class DalObject is a Thread-Safe Singleton with
maximum lazy initialization
* Factory, Singleton and Abstract factory pattern
* Design Pattern - Design by contract for Data layer
* Design Pattern - Design by contract for Business layer
* Maximum Data Binding between elements in window and code-
behind
* Interface implementations and ISP INotifyPropertyChanged forMVVM
* The shape of the controls varies symmetrically in the expansion /
contraction of the windows
* Intuitive and easy-to-understand user interface
* Specific exceptions for each error
* Property Triggers
* Data Triggers
* Event Triggers
* Data Template
* IValueConverter
* Styles
* Themes
* Control Template
* Transform
* Live GPS (1hr=1sec) of drone carrying out task (meaning location is calculated based on bearing, distance and speed) (very hard to do...)
* UI/UX Design meant to be easy to the eye and comfortable to use
* +100 hours of work put into this project by myself
* Bonus file structure (DalXml, DalApi...)
* Using LINQ and Query Language (from) wherever possible 
* Delegate/Predicates
* Anonymous functions/Lambas
* Map showing the user where each object is (pinpoint location with OpenStreetMaps)
* More not specified as I did as many bonuses as possible
